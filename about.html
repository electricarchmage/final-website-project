      <h1>About me</h1>
      <p>I'm someone who always seeks to grow and change with time. Whether it's adapting to new technologies on-the-fly, finding new conditions that need to be dealt with, or meeting new requirements that burgeon forth like weeds, I always try to meet change with enthusiasm. As someone a little too obsessed with technological development, such an attitude suits me well; the times we live in now require such an approach to succeed. As such, I've found the chance to work with many such technologies in the past. Having helped lead over a dozen hackathons in many different tech specializations, built software that uses fine-tuned local large language models, and having even 3D modeled and filmed short videos with Blender, I have gained many skills and abilities to further my philosophy of meeting the world at its present rather than its past.

      <h2>Approach</h2>
      <p>I do pragmatic engineering: thoughtful API design, sensible abstractions, and testable components. I value clarity, instrumentation, and code that other engineers can confidently change.</p>

      <h2>Tools & stack</h2>
      <ul class="stack-list">
        <li>Python (scripting, ML pipelines)</li>
        <li>Node / TypeScript (services & bots)</li>
        <li>React (frontend)</li>
        <li>Docker & CI/CD</li>
        <li>Postgres / SQLite</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Fun projects</h2>
      <p>I like messing around with local AI systems, from text and image generators to video models every now and again. I also participate in hackathons relatively often, working with anything from .NET to homemade social media apps. Speed is a specialty of mine.</p>
